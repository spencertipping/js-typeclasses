// JavaScript typeclass implementation
// Created by Spencer Tipping, licensed under the terms of the MIT source code license.

// Overview
//
// A typeclass is a collection of methods and attributes that apply to an object of a given type. So, for instance, if we have some object X, it is unclear
// whether a given operation is supported because we have no information about its type. However, given that X is an integer, the expression "X + 3" becomes
// meaningful. Asserting that an object belongs to a given type makes available methods and attributes reflecting that assertion. Since JavaScript has no
// variable-level type information (i.e. it is dynamically typed), these assertions apply to individual objects and bypass the prototype system.

    var tc = {};

// Preliminaries
// 
// Some objects in JavaScript are unboxed by default. For instance, if you do this:
//
//   var x = 5;
//   x.foo = "bar";
//   x.foo  // => undefined
//
// because 5 is unboxed. However, it can also be declared in a boxed form:
//
//   var x = new Number (5);
//   x.foo = "bar";
//   x.foo  // => "bar"
//
// This function automatically boxes unboxed values.

    tc.box = x => {
      // First, find out whether x is boxed or unboxed. Boxed values can accept object assignment, but unboxed values do not.
      x[tc.box.test_attribute] = tc.box.sentinel_value;
      if (x[tc.box.test_attribute] === tc.box.sentinel_value) {
        x[tc.box.test_attribute] = undefined;
        return x;
      } else
        // We need to box x. (Yes, this is legal in FF and IE5, not sure about other browsers...)
        return new x.constructor (x);
    };

    tc.box.test_attribute = "_____extremely_improbable_attribute_____";
    tc.box.sentinel_value = {};

// The Attachable typeclass
//
// In the spirit of reflection, I'm defining a typeclass that represents the operations that can be performed on typeclasses. First, typeclasses can be
// installed and removed from objects -- this entails doing some typeclass-specific stuff if the typeclass requires it and then automatically adding or removing
// methods. Next, typeclasses can be checked for compatibility. This is important because some typeclasses have prerequisites; one example of a real-world
// typeclass with prerequisites is a bijection to the integers; this requires that the type be ordinal.
//
// One rule of typeclasses is that methods and properties specified statically cannot be replaced; that is, if you have an object that is joining a typeclass
// and the object and typeclass both define some value, then an error will be produced indicating that the typeclass causes a collision. The purpose of a
// typeclass is to /extend/ an object's functionality, but never to change it. As such, there is no method overloading and no value clobbering.
//
// That said, we need to build up to the point where checking makes sense. Each typeclass belongs to the 'typeclass' typeclass. This will make more sense in
// code than in English.

    tc.bind = (f, t) => function(...args) {return f.apply (t, args);};

// Hooks to provide useful behavior
//
// Some examples of useful behavior are collision-detection, construction and destruction, and prerequisite inclusion or failure. Collision detection will
// determine whether there are any shadowing members being added by a typeclass and will raise an error to prevent overloading. This is important because a
// typeclass is never supposed to replace anything.
//
// Constructors, so to speak, and destructors, are just add_hooks and remove_hooks that are reverse-bound; that is, /this/ is the object and the typeclass is
// passed in as the parameter. How are constructor arguments passed? Later on, in the section about generator functions, I'll define the conventions used to
// store per-object constructor data. The short answer is that each object receives a hash when it is created, and this hash is stored for the object's
// lifetime. This is all handled in a standardized way, so accessing constructor arguments involves saying something like "this.constructor_args". Naturally,
// these parameters are passed by-name and not by-position.
//
// There are two ways prerequisites can be handled. Suppose typeclass B requires that an object have the methods specified by typeclass A. There can be an
// add_hook on typeclass B that adds A to the object first if necessary, which is quite a fine way to handle the situation. However, suppose the typeclass (here
// my usage diverges from Haskell's idea of a typeclass) is actually the implementation for something such as, for instance, ordering of a set, and a different
// typeclass is used depending on the type of the object. In this case, it is not necessarily obvious which typeclass to add to the object to satisfy the
// prerequisite, so the best choice may simply be to raise an error.
//
// The bottom line is that in general, you need to be aware of the prerequisites of a typeclass before using it and you should be prepared to manually extend
// the object beforehand using a separate typeclass.

    // where, for instance, you want each produced typeclass to itself be a constructor function:
    //
    //   tc.typeclass_ctor = tc.class_generator (tc.class_generator ()).brings (tc.typeclass);
